Text analyzer that uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to detect text from handwritten notes and turns notes into a Notion page

Bugs:
- when a bullet point has text spanning more than one line, only the first line is parsed as a bullet point, while the remaining lines are separated and parsed as paragraphs

This is only to showcase my project and code.
Since the dotenv file with API keys is hidden, you cannot build and run the program.
